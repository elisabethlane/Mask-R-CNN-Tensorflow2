# Mask-R-CNN-Tensorflow2
My implementation of Mask R-CNN updated to Tensorflow 2 with training script.

Please note, to run this code you will need to download the trained model weights using the COCO dataset ('mask_rcnn_coco.h5'). 
Find it here: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases/tag/v2.0

Inference script and instructions coming soon...
